-   The Mediator design pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
-   The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct communication among the components. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their colleagues.
